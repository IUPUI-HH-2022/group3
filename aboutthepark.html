      <p>Kenai Fjords National Monument was initially designated by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978, using the Antiquities Act, pending final legislation to resolve the allotment of public lands in Alaska (Source). Establishing Kenai Fjords as a National Park followed the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980. National Park was established in 1980 by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). Under the provisions of ANILCA the park included 119,000 acres (185.9 sq mi; 481.6 km2) of "native selected lands," property that was taken out of federal ownership and conveyed to Alaskan native corporations.
