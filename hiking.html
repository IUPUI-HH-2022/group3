          There are several maintained trails in Kenai&nbsp;Fjords National&nbsp;Park in the Exit Glacier Area. They include short trails on the valley floor and the 8-mile loop Harding&nbsp;Icefield&nbsp;Trail. The short trails start at the Exit Glacier Nature Center near the parking lot. Glacier View Loop Trail leads to breathtaking Glacier&nbsp;View from the Harding&nbsp;Icefield. This loop trail is only 1 mile long. For those who want to hike more there is a 6 miles loop trail to the Exit Glacier Overlook via the well-maintained Glacier Overlook Trail.

          If you are looking for a stunning longer day hike, there is an 8,2-mile round trip Harding Icefield Trail starting at the Exit Glacier Area. Be prepared for tough ups and downs as the trail starts at the valley floor and climbs above the tree line. It might take you 6-8 hours for the hike but you will be rewarded with the wonderful views from the top. It&apos;s better to prepare for the different weather conditions and apply SPF cream. You will also need your own drinking water or a filter. It is highly recommended to stay on the trail and respect the work of volunteers who maintain this trail.

      <p>There are different types of colorblindness. Let's have a look at each:</p>
      <ul class="vlist">
        <li><b>Deuteranomaly:</b> The most common form of color blindness. A person cannot see green and may have difficulty distinguishing between reds, greens, browns and oranges. They also commonly confuse different types of blue and purple hues.</li>
        <li><b>Deuteranopia: </b>Color green appears similar to color red.</li>
        <li><b>Protanomaly:</b> Red may appear as dark gray and every color that contains red may be less bright.</li>
        <li><b>Protanopia:</b> Reds or greens not seen properly. Colors that contain red will also look different.</li>
        <li><b>Tritanomaly: </b> Blue is seen green. Yellow is seen faintly or not at all.</li>
        <li><b>Tritanopia: </b> Colors blue and yellow cannot be told apart.</li>
      </ul>
