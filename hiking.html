          There are several maintained trails in Kenai&nbsp;Fjords National&nbsp;Park in the Exit Glacier Area. They include short trails on the valley floor and the 8-mile loop Harding&nbsp;Icefield&nbsp;Trail. The short trails start at the Exit Glacier Nature Center near the parking lot. Glacier View Loop Trail leads to breathtaking Glacier&nbsp;View from the Harding&nbsp;Icefield. This loop trail is only 1 mile long. For those who want to hike more there is a 6 miles loop trail to the Exit Glacier Overlook via the well-maintained Glacier Overlook Trail. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for a stunning longer day hike, there is an 8,2-mile round trip Harding Icefield Trail starting at the Exit Glacier Area. Be prepared for tough ups and downs as the trail starts at the valley floor and climbs above the tree line. It might take you 6-8 hours for the hike but you will be rewarded with the wonderful views from the top. It&apos;s better to prepare for the different weather conditions and apply SPF cream. You will also need your own drinking water or a filter. It is highly recommended to stay on the trail and respect the work of volunteers who maintain this trail.
          </p>
          <p>
          See below the trail details as shown on National Park Service website, as well our redesigned, inclusive design friendly version of the map. In the redesigned map, different trail parts are indicated with various patterns, which makes it easier to use the map.
