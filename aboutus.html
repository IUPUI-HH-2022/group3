    <div class="text1">Hi, my name is Teija and I study Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. Before starting my studies in January 2022, I had been working in customer service and account management, mostly in the travel industry. I am, however, extremely interested in the field of IT and looking to becoming an IT professional. I am from Finland but have spent about 11 years living abroad, mostly in the UK and only returned to my home country at the end of 2018. In my free time I love yoga, singing in a choir and cooking.</div>
