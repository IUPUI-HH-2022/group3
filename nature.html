          Kenai&nbsp;Fjords National&nbsp;Park offers calm outstanding views of the sea, ice-bound landscapes and misty mountains. Located on the southeastern Kenai&nbsp;Peninsula in Alaska, the national park is an ancient and wild land that contains a wide variety of ecosystems. A land of ice and glaciers that fill narrow mountain valleys, and a coastline where thousands of seabirds and marine mammals breed each year. 191 species of birds can be found there. The Kenai&nbsp;Fjords National&nbsp;Park gets its name from the long, glacier-carved valleys now filled with ocean water. From the seaside, the edges of the Kenai mountains descend into the sea. The wildlife of the park is as varied as its landscape. Black and brown bears, mountain goats, beavers, coyotes, river otters, snowshoe hares, moose, wolverines, marmots and other land mammals have settled in the thin zone of life between the sea and the ice fields. Life blooms in the fjords in summer. Sea lions roost on rocky islands, such marine mammals like sea otters and gray, humpback minke whales, killer whales, ply the waters of the fjord.
